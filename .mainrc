## The goals of the init file is to teleport all the
## environment to the portable device in a secure
## encrypted layer for basic functions and services

## The whoami and / (root) directories need to be 
## overriden or resolved for the property portable
## operating system to live

## All users of the lkso device will live in the
## lkso dimension and will teleport through the lucky
## network protocol for a secure and untracable communication
## between the devices, meaning that if a user is performing
## tasks in one lkso device then that same user can not use
## its power in any other lkso device as the same user while
## each user can be either a human user or an agent user
